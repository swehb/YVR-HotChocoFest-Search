# YVR Hot Chocolate Festival Search
Vancouver, BC has an annual hot chocolate festival with numerous vendors. As of 2023 there is no search on the website. This program allows a user to search for a specific keyword, e.g. "white chocolate", "cinnamon", etc. Each vendor's page has a list of their available flavours. The program returns a link to each vendor's page if the keyword appears on that page. 

This program was written with Python. It uses Selenium and BeautifulSoup.
